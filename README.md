# hypnopics-collective.net scrapper

A scrapper for https://hypnopics-collective.net/  
It downloads all images from a user, as well as the metadatas (title, description, keywords, date, views, etc...)  

It currently doesn't have threading, which makes it quite slow, but it works  

The "Fast mode" uses an alternate faster method that can't scrape favorites, description and keywords  

Please leave a star if you found this useful!


### Cool features  
Fast mode to download way faster since you're using the index directly  
Pick up where you left off if the download crashed  
Good error handling if i do say so myself

### todo  
add threading
